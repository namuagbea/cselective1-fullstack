# Dental Clinic Appointment System

The _Dental Clinic Appointment System_ allows potential customers to book an appointment online via the dental clinic’s website, providing a hassle-free and convenient solution versus the traditional appointment system. With this, customers can be assured that their visit to the clinic will be on their scheduled day.

## Features

* Seamless Online Bookings — Allows customers to book their appointments online and not have to go to the clinic just to schedule a date.
* Patient Profiles — The system would have a stored background information of the patients medical history and treatment preferences for personalized care.
* Calendar Management — Users of the system, be it an admin or a patient, would have access to the system’s calendar appointments to manage availability and eliminate the possibility of double bookings and the like.
* Patient Communication — Patients would be notified of their upcoming appointments via their respective emails or SMS, whichever they prefer. This allows communication between the patients and clinic staff regarding appointments and necessary procedures.

Overall, the application provides convenience and ease of use for all its benefactors.
